        <h1>At <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/s/sustainability-report/index.html"targe="_blank" title="html5 specification">Goldman Sachs</a>, sustainability is an important driver of our engagement with clients and how we conduct our business.</h1>
         We provide the advice and capital companies need to grow, the expertise needed to manage risks, and the information and perspectives our clients must have to make business and investment decisions. Increasingly, all of these activities demand focus on sustainability issues, from the looming impacts of climate change, to health-and safety-associated risks, to credit and investment gaps that limit business opportunities and hamper economic progress in many parts of the world.
